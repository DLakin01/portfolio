title: Habits of thought

---

When I first had the idea of pursuing coding, it was out of desperation. I had tried to walk another path, tried to pursue another career, but without real success and decreasing chances of changing that. I flirted with the idea of going to law school, going so far as to take the LSAT and apply to several schools. I ultimately pulled back from that option, and am glad of it. Although the end is not assured at all, my experience with Bloc so far has been overwhelmingly positive, and I do genuinely feel that I am learning a valuable and marketable skill.

My habits of thought have changed. Where before I would stare at a page filled with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and see nothing but dense gibberish, I can now pick apart chunks, turn them over in my head, and think about what they do, and in what relation to other parts of an application or project. I can think in loops, imagine groupings of data or information in arrays, objects, or arrays of objects. I am trying to master the larger and more important discipline of DRY, or Don’t Repeat Yourself. If I can attain a certain level of elegance and flow in my code, and at the same time write no more (or close to no more) than I have to, I will have gained a truly important skill.

It’s fascinating how certain methods, properties, or larger concepts can seem utterly foreign or indecipherable for days at a time, and then suddenly slide into place. Suddenly, I can see what the documentation really meant, and how to use the options offered by a certain bit of code. My understanding of the Document Object Model, or DOM, is a perfect example. Reading through those lessons for the first time, I was practically mentally paralyzed. The concepts of a tree of page elements studded with nodes that I could locate and manipulate did not come easily. However, within days, I was using JavaScript, and later jQuery, with increasing ease to locate and change nodes on the DOM. I have used it to create animations, populate HTML templates, and play music.

In the days ahead, there will certainly be new topics that will seem as foreign and confusing to me as the DOM did. However, with time, patience, and effort, I will one day soon find those topics sliding as easily and effortlessly into place as others already have.
